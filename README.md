Fire and Smoke Detection System

Overview: An automated safety system designed to detect fire and toxic gases using Arduino Uno.

Features: 
* Gas Detection: Uses an MQ series sensor to trigger a buzzer and LED when smoke is detected.
* Temperature Monitoring: Uses a TMP sensor; triggers an alarm if heat exceeds 70°C.
* Simulation: Fully designed and tested on Tinkercad.
